# Adam's Method and ConvNets in Image Classification

Adamâ€™s Method is a stochastic gradient-based optimization
algorithm that utilizes adaptive estimates of stochastic functions and replacement optimization
in order to train deep learning models. This method is well-suited for big data with many
parameters since efficient stochastic optimization techniques are required to account for noisy
objectives. Furthermore, CNN architecture is composed of many unique layers conducive to
detecting different features in an image. The accuracy of these numerical methods will be
analyzed through sampling and initiating a loss function
